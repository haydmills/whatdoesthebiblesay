        <hr>
        <p>The Bible has much to say on the topic of abiding. Abiding defined means "continuing for a long time: enduring". The Bible mentions "abiding" 29 times directly.</p>

        <h5>Biblical References</h5>
        <p><b>John 15:4-10</b></p>
        <p>4 Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. 5 “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. 6 If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. 7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8 This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. 9 “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. 10 If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love. <a href="#">Click to copy text</a></p>
        <p><b>1 John 2:24</b></p>
        <p>24 As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <a href="#">Click to copy text</a></p>
        <p><b>1 John 4:13-16</b></p>
        <p>13 This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 16 And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. <a href="#">Click to copy text</a></p>
        <p><b>2 John 9</b></p>
        <p>9 Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. <a href="#">Click to copy text</a></p>
